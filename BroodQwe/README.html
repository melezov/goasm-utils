<b>Welcome to BroodQwe!</b>

<hr>
<b>BroodQwe</b> is a stand alone executable which will enhance the BroodWar (C) experience
through remapping the 9 key block [ QWE ASD ZXC ] to fit the 3 x 3 BroodWar (R) control panel.

<B>HELL, IT's ABOUT TIME! :D</b>

It's written entirely in assembler, and is less then 4 kb in size. Download it <a href="http://www.anime42.com/BroodQwe/BroodQwe.exe">here</a>!

<hr>
Current version of <b>BroodQwe</b> (1.01a) was built on: <b>03-June-2007</b>.
BroodQwe is open source, and is available at the following <a href="http://www.anime42.com/BroodQwe/BroodQwe.zip">link</a> (~120 kb).

Currently, the source package is utterly undocumented, but should assemble and link itself
neatly <b>WITHOUT ANY THIRD PARTY TOOLS</b>. This is because I've included Jeremy Gordon's
<a href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk">GoTools</a> suite including a resource compiler, assembler and linker.
You don't need anything other then Notepad (TM) or your favorite assembler IDE.

<hr>
The current features list:
<ul><li><b>BloodQwe will function on every standard keyboard layout.</b>

I've originally written BroodQwe as a helper program which would help me play
BroodWar (INC) on a DVORAK keyboard layout, since I only knew the QWERTZ/QWERTY
positions. All this mucking about with virtual key codes was abandoned, since
BroodQwe uses keyboard scan codes which are identical on all keyboards regardless
of their layout. In the unlikely event that it does not function properly, please
do send me an email shout.

<li><b>BroodQwe will optionally block mouse input to the mentioned control panel.</b>

This is used to train the player to utterly abandon mouse actions over the
control panel and concentrate the mouse interaction on actions that can't be
done by only using the keyboard.

<li><b>BroodQwe will optionally emit an irritating PING when it blocks mouse input.</b>

PING me once, shame on you.
PING me twice, shame on me.

<li><b>BroodQwe will install a global hotkey for activating and deactivating itself.</b>

This way you can always be sure that it's dead when you go into the channels for
chat, or make sure it's active when the game is starting. 5..4..3..2..1.. WHoosh!

<li><b>BroodQwe will detect the Enter keystroke and disable itself until Enter or
Escape has been pressed.</b>

This will allow the player to chat without having to manually reset BroodQwe via the
hotkey the every time.
</ul><hr>
<b>BroodQwe will NOT do any of the following things:</b>
<ul><li>Install anything. Not even itself.
<li>Retrieve any information regarding your software / hardware / credit cards.
</ul><hr>
Updates so far:
<ul><li><b>1.01a</b> - BroodQwe now uses absolute instead of relative mouse
positioning. This is due to the retarded way Windoze handles mouse
events. In order to position the cursor properly, you need to check
mouse acceleration, and two mouse movement thresholds. The good part
is that BroodQwe now positions itself regarding the current resolution.
This means that the same code can now be used even if BroodWar (LTD)
ran in a resolution other then 640 x 480.

<li><b>1.00a</b> - Initial release
</ul><hr>
